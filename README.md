# ASSIGNMENT API TESTS

# Postman API Workspace

This repository contains a Postman collection where all variables are handled via pre-scripts and post-scripts.

## Contents

- **QTRIP_API_TEST_postman_collection.json**: The Postman collection with pre-scripts and post-scripts.
- **QTRIP API TEST-2024-09-09-14-01-52-240-0.html:** Simple report
- **README.md:** Refers to the current file.

## Usage

1. Download the Postman collection file.
2. Import the collection into your Postman workspace.
3. The collection's pre-scripts will automatically set the necessary variables (e.g., `api_key`, `base_url`) before each request.
4. Post-scripts are used to assert responses and save variables for chaining requests.
